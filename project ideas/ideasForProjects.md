Here are some ideas for projects:

- Digital russekort, collect the cards to your collection by scanning QR-codes or typing in a specific code. The russ has to create a card which people can collect for their collection. At the same time, the russ can also collect other russ' cards. In this app, there should be a leaderboard where you get points for collecting the cards, if the card is rare, you get more points. The russ is a separate leaderboard where the leaderboard is based off of how many cards that are given out. To be able to log in as russ, you must log in with feide, so you can only register a user, once.

- Code your own webcard in the browser!
